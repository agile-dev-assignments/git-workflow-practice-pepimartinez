# Paragraph
What I found most interesting about this article is the new python web framework it talks about. I have been using Django and Flask for almost 3 years now and I am very surprised to see FastAPI come on to the scene. As a new framework it does not have the same community support that an older framework like Django has. However, the community support on FastAPI has been promising and lots of people have been using FastAPI in their new projects. The breakthrough here is the asyncronous nature of FastAPI vs its Django and Flask counterparts. This brings up an important question. How will Django change over the next couple of years to keep up with the preformance increases that a framework like FastAPI brings to the table? Will Django have a rewrite in a couple years, will they try and reinvent the framework to catch up?

## Lee's Comments
>*I just find it really interesting that so much development goes on, seemingly right under our noses. There are many frameworks and as time goes on they can get outdates and replaced so quickly, which just shows how essential it is to stay on top of the newest information in this field*
